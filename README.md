pic2charactor.py is made to run on individual image and generate a txt file. I haven't thought much about displaying single images.

main.py and player.py is for videos, as main will automatically split video to frames, feed it to pic2charactor.py and then create a .dat file for player.py to run.

ASCII live camera is as the name suggests, might need more adjustment on contrast for better results. 

Someone suggested adding background removal for the live camera, so I'll add it to my list.
